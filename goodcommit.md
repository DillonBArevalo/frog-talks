## Why make a good commit?
1. They are part of your portfolio
2. Your potential employers will look at them

## What makes a good commit message?
1. Present tense
2. Imperative Mood
3. Good to limit to 50 characters because more than that causes a ... in github
4. Capitalize the subject
5. Do not end with a period
6. We've been using the title line only, however a more multiline commit will get at the Hows and the Whys of what was done.
